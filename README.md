# Tests for Jira using BDD

Hey! My name is MÃ¡rk, and in this project I tested the most cruical features of Jira.
My test environment was set up in a certain way, so not all tests pass on my end (how it should be).
In this project I wanted to practice BDD, and chose to go with POM and KDT.
I tried to write the code as clean as possible, but I'm always open for comments and improvements on it.

# Technologies Used

I used mostly Java, for the BDD part I used Cucumber and Gherkin
